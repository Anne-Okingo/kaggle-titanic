## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. We will explore the dataset, perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights, and build predictive models to achieve a high accuracy score on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Feature Engineering
(To be updated after implementation)
We will explore features such as:
- **Title Extraction**: Extracting titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) from names.
- **Family Size**: Combining SibSp and Parch.
- **Fare Binning**: Grouping fare values.
- **Age Imputation**: Handling missing age values.
